/**
 * The Kapsel Logger plugin provides a Cordova plugin wrapper around the SAP Mobile Platform client logging API. 
 * <br><br>
 *
 * The Logger plugin has ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG log levels and log messages are captured based on the configured and selected log level. 
 * A Kapsel application can be set to these log levels by programmatic control, and by the administrator changing a setting on the server. 
 * For Android and iOS, the default log level is ERROR, so by default only ERROR level logs are captured.
 * sap.Logger.setLogLevel() method is used to set other levels. If you want to get log messages at all log levels, 
 * you must set the log level to DEBUG. (DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR) <br>
 * If the log level is set to DEBUG, the application captures all log messages. <br>
 * If you set the log level to INFO, the application captures INFO, WARN, and ERROR log messages. <br>
 * If you set the log level to WARN, the application captures WARN and ERROR log messages. <br>
 * If you set the log level to ERROR, the application captures only Error log messages. 
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Using the provided sap.Logger.upload() method allows developers to upload a log file to SAP Mobile Platform Server, 
 * where an administrator can view them and remotely set the appropriate log level to control the amount of information 
 * that is written to the log. When the sap.Logger.upload() method is triggered, a log file will be uploaded.
 * If the Log Upload checkbox is selected in the Management Cockpit, the client can upload a log file by calling sap.Logger.upload(). 
 * If the Log Upload checkbox is disabled in the Management Cockpit, the client does not upload the log file to the server. The attempt to upload causes an "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden" error. 
 * To support manual uploading of the log, you should implement a button or some other mechanism that calls sap.Logger.upload() when needed.
 * <br>
 * For the Logger plugin to upload a log file these conditions must be met: 1) Log Upload checkbox enabled In the Management Cockpit 2) sap.Logger.upload() is called by developer.
 * <br>
 * The expected work flow, with the current architecture consists of the following: <br>
 * 1) If a user has an issue that needs to be analyzed by an administrator or developer, the user reports the issue as appropriate.<br>
 * 2) The administrator, or developer, enables the log collection for the user on the SAP Mobile Platform server.<br> 
 * 3) The administrator lets the user know that he, or she, can upload log file. <br>
 * 4) The user uploads thelog file to the server, and the administrator gets the uploaded log file in the Management Cockpit.<br>
 * 5) The administrator sends the file to the developer to debug.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * Currently, on iOS, if the current log level is ERROR (default level), only ERROR level messages are displayed on the console 
 * even if other log level messages are generated. But if the current log level is DEBUG, INFO, or WARN, 
 * all generated log messages, regardless of log level, are displayed on the console. <br>
 * On Android, if the current log level is ERROR, only ERROR level messages are displayed in the Android logcat view (console).
 * if log level is INFO, then ERROR, WARN and INFO level messages are displayed in the Android logcat view (console).  
 * <br><br>
 *
 * When the Kapsel Settings plugin is added to the project, Settings will: 1) Get log level from the server 2) Set it into Logger on the client 
 * 3) Call sap.Logger.upload() after a logon success event, for example, when the app is launched or resumed and logon is successful. 
 * The Settings plugin retrieves the selected log level(type) from the Management Cockpit on the server,
 * sets the log level to Logger plugin, and then automatically uploads a log file to the server.
 * If the Settings plugin is not added to the project, a log file can be uploaded only by the developer calling the sap.Logger.upload() method manually.
 * To upload a log file automatically, settings plugin is required.
 * In the Management Cockpit, in the Client Logging dialog box, the Log Upload checkbox is able to enable or disable log file upload, and you can choose the log type(level). 
 * You can also view a list of the uploaded log files. On the server side, there are seven log types: NONE, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG and PATH. 
 * Since the Kapsel Logger plugin supports only DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR, the Logger plugin implicitly matches FATAL to ERROR, and PATH to DEBUG.
 * If NONE is set in the Management Cockpit, Logger sets it to default log level.
 * <br><br>
